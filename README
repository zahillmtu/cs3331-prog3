ThreadMentor Multi-threaded Programming assignment

Question 1:
   No, there are no race conditions because no data is being acccesed
   concurrently. Each computation reads from data that is no longer being
   changed and writes to a place that is not yet being read, therefore
   no collisions occur.

Question 2:
   If the parents have the correct value then after the computation
   the child will have the correct value. Given that the initial values
   cannot be "incorrect", each successive computation will be correct,
   and any value not updated will be passed down to 

Question 3:
   The value cannot be saved back into x[i]. The value x[i] could be 
   needed for futher calculations in another thread in run h. Overwriting
   x[i] would result in inaccurate data for the other calculations.

Question 4:
   The solution for a specific index can be found only if the two
   parent solutions have already been found. Given n Threads, one for 
   each index, a thread could use busy waiting to wait until the 
   parent solutions were found and then could find it's own.
